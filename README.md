# Data Mining Projects

This repository contains various data mining projects completed for coursework or personal exploration.

## Project Overview

Currently, this repository includes:

- **DM_PR1**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the Adult dataset, demonstrating dimensionality reduction techniques and data visualization.

## Setup Instructions

Each project has its own environment and dependencies. Check the individual project's README for specific instructions.

### General Setup

Most projects use Python and can be set up with:

1. Create a virtual environment:
```
python -m venv env
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - Windows: `env\Scripts\activate`
   - macOS/Linux: `source env/bin/activate`

3. Install dependencies (from the project directory):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Projects

### DM_PR1: PCA on Adult Dataset

A project demonstrating Principal Component Analysis on the Adult dataset to reduce dimensionality and visualize patterns.

Key features:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature encoding and normalization
- Manual PCA implementation
- Visualization of reduced dimensions
- K-means clustering on PCA results
